    I went outside to look at the night sky. In the southwest sky I witnessed what I thought was going to be a shooting star but after a couple seconds it never fell, it never took off. Instead it belled out and began to pulsate passing through different tones of light pink similiar to a jet engine passing through different color flames. It was so cool I just remember thinking how am I going to find out what that was and that I must have been the only one in the neighborhood to see it because it only took place within a two inch square patch of sky.

    After editing settings according to your tutorial, Emmet still don't works inside .njk by default.  Found the reason - we should turn on from "plain text" to "html" in the bottom panel of VScode when file .njk opens!
